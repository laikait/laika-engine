# Laika Core Documentation

`laikait/laika-core` is the core of the Laika PHP Framework. It provides:

- **HTTP:** request, response, redirects, CORS, CSRF, validation
- **Application plumbing:** configuration, resource discovery, hooks, localisation, app key
- **Templates:** Twig rendering, assets, meta tags, navigation, icons
- **Security helpers:** encryption, JWT, IDs, sanitizers, regex rules
- **Files and storage:** local/S3/JSON/Redis/Memcached storage, uploads, images, zips
- **Utilities:** dates, arbitrary-precision math, cron, shell commands
- **Data:** the options table and the activity log
- **Error handling** and the **global helper functions** templates and apps rely on

Most of it is reached through relays, static proxy classes in the `Laika\Engine\Services` namespace, for example `Url::base()` or `Request::input('email')`. Each relay forwards to a shared instance of a class in `Laika\Engine\...`.

Three components keep their own detailed READMEs next to the code:

- [IP utilities](../src/IP/README.MD): CIDR maths for IPv4 and IPv6
- [Nav builder](../src/Nav/README.MD): menus built from named routes
- [Regex rules](../src/Regex/README.MD): reusable validation patterns

## Conventions in These Pages

- **Relay** means the `Laika\Engine\Services\*` class you call statically. **Class** is the `Laika\Engine\*` class that does the work.
- Method tables list signatures exactly as they appear in the source.
- **Note** boxes flag behaviour that is easy to get wrong. They describe the code as it is, not as it might be expected to work.
