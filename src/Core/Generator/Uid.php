 * **Use this instead of Laika\Engine\Model\Model::uid().** That method returns an
 * 8-8-8-8 string (`318d8795-7baf03e3-8775c4bd-7eb86394`) which is not a valid
 * UUID, and `Blueprint::uid()` maps to a native UUID type on some drivers -
 * `UUID` on PostgreSQL, `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` on SQL Server. Those drivers reject
 * the framework's value outright, while MySQL (`VARCHAR(38)`) and SQLite
 * (`TEXT`) accept it, so the bug would only appear after a port. Generating a
 * real UUID here keeps one value legal on every driver laika-model supports.
 *
 * Records are addressed by uid in URLs rather than by the auto-increment key,
 * so a link never discloses how many clients or invoices exist.
