/**
 * The One Place Per-Process State is Reset
 *
 * The framework memoises a lot for the life of a process: every config file,
 * every option, the asset rules, trusted proxies, the request's headers, the
 * visitor's IP. Under FPM a process is one request, so none of it is ever
 * stale. A process that serves many -- the queue worker, which without pcntl
 * runs every job in one long-lived process -- sees the first job's state
 * forever unless something clears it.
 *
 * Several of these already had a reset method. None was ever called. They are
 * gathered here so a new memo has exactly one place to be registered, and the
 * host has exactly one thing to call.
